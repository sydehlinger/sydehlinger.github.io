        <h1>General Education</h1>
        <p><strong>GE1: What are your current short/long term goals? You may include your “ideal” career in engineering or your preferred working environment.</strong></p>
        <p>Graduate from Iowa State in December 2019 with a BS in Software Engineering. I plan on moving out the Midwest to Pittsburgh, PA to work at PNC Financial as a Software Developer. I hope to get the chance to move around the county and experience a multitude of different software development at different companies.</p>
        <p><strong>GE2: What have you learned in your general education electives, which allow you to formulate and evaluate engineering solutions in problem solving and innovation beyond the technical aspects in problem solving? How do general education classes help you to think about an engineering problem?</strong></p>
        <p>General education classes allow you to look at an engineering problem from different angles. For example, physics is helpful if working on a project with moveable parts. You have a better understanding of the system as a whole.</p>
        <p><strong>GE3: Relate what you have learned in general education classes to seeing beyond the engineering solution in problem solving and innovation. What are some other dimensions to consider and what impact do they have in an economic, global or societal context?</strong></p>
        <p>General education classes have helped me see beyond just the engineering solution. It allows me to see that maybe not engineering is always the solution. Sometimes it’s a diversity issue or a psychology issue and can’t be just solved with engineering.</p>
