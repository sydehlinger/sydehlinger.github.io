        <h2>Scene</h2>
        <h5>COM S 309 Project</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Scene was an application to recommend different restaurants and events going
            on around you based on your Facebook likes or a personal quiz you took.
            From there, users could like and dislike resturants and events, which
            would then help the application learn more about their likes and dislikes.
            They could also accept events they were going to, so they could be
            notified when the evetn was coming up, and it would share with their
            friends that they were going.</li>
          <li>Repositiory Lead: As the repository lead I accepted merge
          requests, fixed merge conflicts, and set up the overall development
          structure.</li>

        <h2>Hackathon Registration</h2>
        <h5>Personal Project</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>This application was initally created for registration and check-in
            for Digital Women's annual Hackathon, Code Camp. The main goal of
            this application was to help make the check-in process easier.
            Previously, we used Major League Hacking's registration form, which
            had all registrants just in a excel sheet. We then had a hard time
            searching the excel when peole checked in and keeping count of the
            amount of people who had checked in and who hadn't. In addition to
            this issue, people were allowed to sign-up throughout the whole event.
            By just having it in an excel file, all the proper information we
            needed wasn't always filled out by those who were running the
            check-in table. By having an application for this instead it made
            getting the correct information when people signed up easier and
            also made keeping track of the amount of people who checked in.</li>
          <li>Skills or knowledge gained: Typeform, Zapier, Google Sheets API, Heroku</li>
          <li>Resources used</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Digital Women Website</h2>
        <h5>Webmaster</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Website for Digital Women student organization at Iowa State.
          When I orginally took over the website I had to do a lot of cleaning and organization
          of the code. A lot of it was being unused and was commented it out. Also
          I decided to use Bootstrap to help the overall organization of the site,
          as everything before was being hard coded. This was the first time I had
          ever worked on a project on the Iowa State servers.</li>
          <li>Skills or knowledge gained: Bootstrap, first time working on a
          website hosted on a server</li>
