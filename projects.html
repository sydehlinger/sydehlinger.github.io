            <p class="card-text">This application was initally created for registration and check-in
              for Digital Women's annual Hackathon, Code Camp. The main goal of
              this application was to help make the check-in process easier.
              Previously, we used Major League Hacking's registration form, which
              had all registrants just in a excel sheet. We then had a hard time
              searching the excel when peole checked in and keeping count of the
              amount of people who had checked in and who hadn't. In addition to
              this issue, people were allowed to sign-up throughout the whole event.
              By just having it in an excel file, all the proper information we
              needed wasn't always filled out by those who were running the
              check-in table. By having an application for this instead it made
              getting the correct information when people signed up easier and
              also made keeping track of the amount of people who checked in.</p>

            When I orginally took over the website I had to do a lot of cleaning and organization
            of the code. A lot of it was being unused and was commented it out. Also
            I decided to use Bootstrap to help the overall organization of the site,
            as everything before was being hard coded. This was the first time I had
            ever worked on a project on the Iowa State servers.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Scene was an application to recommend different restaurants and events going
              on around you based on your Facebook likes or a personal quiz you took.
              From there, users could like and dislike resturants and events, which
              would then help the application learn more about their likes and dislikes.
              They could also accept events they were going to, so they could be
              notified when the evetn was coming up, and it would share with their
              friends that they were going.</p>
